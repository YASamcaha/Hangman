# <table><tr><td>Hangman</td></tr></table>

## What does it do?
This hangman game uses the functionality of the random module in python to select a random word from a predefined list of words.
The end goal is for the user to correctly guess the word by guessing the letters.

 ##  Usage Instructions
 ###  ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}Setup}}$
1. Create a list of potential words you want the game to use and input into the "word_list"
    1. Ensure the words are all valid and do not contain any non alphabetical elements
  
###  ${\textsf{\color{lightblue}Playing}}$

1. To play ensure you make a valid guess (a single alphabetical input), otherwise it will cause an error!


##  File Structure
